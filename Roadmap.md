Part 1: Definitive Current Features (What Works RIGHT NOW)
This section describes every feature that is fully or partially implemented and functional in the application as of the latest report.

1. Core Infrastructure
Backend Server (FastAPI): A fully functional Python server that acts as the application's brain. It handles all business logic, database interactions, API endpoints, and file processing. It is launched via uvicorn api.main:app --reload.

Frontend Server (React + Vite): A fully functional JavaScript server that runs the user interface. It uses the shadcn/ui component library for a modern, professional look. Path aliases (@/components) are correctly configured. It is launched via npm run dev.

Server Communication: The frontend and backend are correctly configured to communicate. The vite.config.js file proxies all /api/... requests from the frontend to the backend, enabling seamless data flow.

Database (SQLite via SQLModel): A persistent SQLite database (database.db) acts as the application's memory, ensuring all data survives server restarts. It uses SQLModel for data validation and ORM capabilities. The application automatically creates the following tables on startup:

user: Stores user ID, email, hashed password, tier, Google ID, etc.

podcast (or "Show"): High-level containers for episodes (name, description, cover art).

episode: Records for every generated episode, linked to a user and podcast. Tracks status (processing, processed, error).

podcasttemplate: User-created structures for episodes, linked to a user.

mediaitem: A record of every uploaded audio file and image, linked to a user.

2. User Authentication & Routing
Full Authentication System: The application supports two secure methods for login:

Email/Password: Users can register with an email and password. Passwords are never stored directly; they are securely hashed using passlib (bcrypt). The backend endpoints (/api/auth/register and /api/auth/token) are fully functional.

Google OAuth 2.0: Users can sign in with one click using their Google account. The backend handles the entire redirect flow, token exchange with Google, and user creation/lookup.

Security & Session Management:

JWT Tokens: All login methods result in the server issuing a secure JSON Web Token (JWT). This token is required to access all protected API endpoints.

Persistent Login: The JWT is stored in the browser's localStorage, allowing users to remain logged in even after closing the tab.

Global Auth State: A React AuthContext manages the user's authentication state across the entire application.

Protected Routing & User Roles:

The main App.jsx component acts as a router. It shows a LandingPage to logged-out users and the appropriate dashboard to logged-in users.

Once a user logs in, their profile is fetched from /api/auth/users/me.

The app checks if the user's email matches a hardcoded ADMIN_EMAIL. If it matches, the AdminDashboard is rendered; otherwise, the standard PodcastPlusDashboard is shown.

3. The User Dashboard (PodcastPlusDashboard.jsx)
This is the main hub for regular users. It's a multi-screen component that switches between views.

Main View:

Functionality: Shows a welcome message, performance stats, and a list of the user's podcast templates.

Status: Functional. The template list is pulled live from the backend. The performance stats are live but calculated with some mock data on the backend (e.g., total_downloads is a fixed number for now).

Manage Shows (PodcastManager.jsx):

Functionality: Allows a user to create a "Show" (a podcast series) by providing a name, description, and cover image. The image is uploaded first, and then the show data is saved.

Status: Partially Functional. Creating and viewing shows works perfectly. Editing or deleting existing shows is not yet implemented.

Media Library (MediaLibrary.jsx):

Functionality: Allows a user to upload and view all their media files (audio and images), categorized by purpose (e.g., intro, music, podcast_cover). Supports multi-file uploads. Files are stored on the server in media_uploads/ with filenames prepended with the user's ID to prevent conflicts.

Status: Partially Functional. Viewing and uploading files works perfectly. The delete button for individual files is not yet functional.

Template Editor (TemplateEditor.jsx):

Functionality: A powerful interface to create and modify episode structures. A user can name the template, add/reorder segments, and define music rules.

Segment Types: For each segment, a user can choose a source:

Static File: A pre-recorded file from the Media Library.

AI Generated: An AI prompt to generate a script based on the episode's content.

TTS (Direct Script): A specific script to be converted to speech.

Status: Fully Functional. All features, including saving the complex template structure to the backend, are working.

Episode Creator (PodcastCreator.jsx):

Functionality: A step-by-step wizard to assemble a new episode. The user uploads content, gives it a title/description, and selects a Show and a Template from live-data dropdowns. Clicking "Publish" sends all data to the /api/episodes/process-and-assemble endpoint for backend processing.

Status: Fully Functional.

Episode History (EpisodeHistory.jsx):

Functionality: Displays a table of all previously created episodes for the logged-in user, showing their title, creation date, and status (e.g., processing, processed).

Status: Partially Functional. The list displays correctly with live data. The action buttons (Download, Play, Share) are placeholders and do not work.

4. The Admin Dashboard (AdminDashboard.jsx)
User List:

Functionality: Displays a table of every registered user, pulling live data from the /api/admin/users endpoint to show email, join date, status, and tier.

Status: Functional.

Platform Analytics:

Functionality: Shows high-level statistics for the entire platform (total users, total episodes, etc.) by fetching live, aggregated data from the /api/admin/stats endpoint.

Status: Functional.

5. Core Audio & AI Engine (Backend Services)
This is the underlying "magic" of the application, which runs on the backend.

Advanced Audio Processing (pydub):

Volume Normalization: All final audio is automatically normalized to a professional standard of -0.1 dBFS for consistent loudness.

Advanced Stitching with Overlaps: The system uses a "silent canvas" method. It calculates the total required duration based on the template's overlap rules, creates a silent track of that length, and then intelligently places each audio segment (intros, content, outros) onto it at the correct start time. This allows for professional-sounding transitions where music can fade under speech.

AI-Powered Transcription (OpenAI Whisper):

Foundation: Converts speech to text with high accuracy.

Large File Handling: Automatically chunks audio files larger than 25MB, processes each chunk, and seamlessly stitches the resulting text back together.

Word-Level Timestamps: Critically, the transcription captures the precise start and end time of every single word, which enables the automated content cleanup.

AI-Powered Content Cleanup:

Filler Word Removal: Scans the transcript for a hard-coded list of filler words (um, uh, like, etc.) and removes those corresponding audio segments from the recording.

Long Pause Shortening: Finds silent gaps between words longer than 1.25 seconds and shortens them to a more natural 0.5 seconds.

The Master process-and-assemble Workflow: This single, powerful endpoint runs the entire production chain in a specific, logical order to ensure quality output:

Load the main content file and generate a full transcript.

Perform all selected cleanup operations (pauses, fillers) on the main content.

Use the cleaned transcript as context to generate any AI-based intro/outro scripts.

Generate any direct TTS (text-to-speech) segments.

Assemble the final episode using the advanced overlap timing rules from the template.

Apply background music rules to the fully stitched segments.

Normalize the volume of the final, complete audio file.

Save the final MP3 and a timestamped .txt transcript.

Part 2: Consolidated Roadmap & To-Do List
This is the master list of all features that are broken, incomplete, or planned for the future, consolidated from all reports.

1. Immediate Bugs & Incomplete Features
Media Library Deletion: The trash can icon in the MediaLibrary does not work. It needs to be wired to the DELETE /api/media/{media_id} backend endpoint.

Show Management: In PodcastManager, users cannot edit or delete shows. The UI and backend endpoints for these actions need to be built.

Episode History Actions: The Download, Play, and Share buttons in EpisodeHistory are non-functional placeholders.

Template List Actions: The Play and Share buttons on the main dashboard's template list are non-functional placeholders.

Keyword Action Hooks: The checkboxes in the UI for enabling keyword-based actions (e.g., "Check for Flubber," "Check for Intern") are not yet hooked up to the backend workflow.

Music on Outros: The audio processor's logic for applying background music to the entire outro block is incomplete. It works for intros but needs to be finished for outros.

2. Near-Term Feature Development
Full User Registration (Frontend): The backend for email/password sign-up is done. The frontend needs a "Sign Up" form in the LoginModal to be built to call the /api/auth/register endpoint.

Implement Real Spreaker Publishing: The backend endpoint /episodes/publish/spreaker/{filename} is a placeholder. It needs to be built out to use the Spreaker API to handle the actual file upload and update the episode's status to "published" in the database.

Episode Metadata Editing: Users need a way to edit an episode's metadata (title, description, season, etc.) after it has been created. This requires wiring up the input fields in the EpisodeHistory component.

User Tiers Management (Admin): The Admin needs the ability to change a user's tier (e.g., from "free" to "premium"). This requires:

Backend: A new endpoint like PUT /api/admin/users/{user_id}/tier.

Frontend: A dropdown or button in the AdminDashboard's user list to trigger the change.

Implement Publishing Scheduler: The database supports a publish_at field, but no logic uses it. A background worker (e.g., using Celery or FastAPI's BackgroundTasks) needs to be created to check for scheduled episodes and trigger the Spreaker publishing at the correct time.

3. Future & Advanced Features
Billing & Subscriptions (Stripe Integration): A major initiative to handle paid subscriptions. This involves building backend endpoints for checkout sessions and webhooks, and a frontend "Billing" page for users to manage their plans.

User-Configurable Settings: A new "Settings" page where users can customize their experience:

Define a custom list of filler words to remove.

Map keywords to sound effects (e.g., saying "rimshot" automatically inserts rimshot.mp3).

Change the main AI action keywords (e.g., change "Flubber" to "retake").

Advanced Transcript Handling:

Post-Cleanup Accuracy: Re-transcribe the audio after all edits are made to produce a 100% accurate final transcript.

Timestamp Adjustment: Adjust the final transcript's timestamps to account for the added duration of intros/outros.

Phrase Detection: Upgrade the keyword detector service to find and act on multi-word phrases (e.g., "Podcast Plus") instead of just single words.

"Intern" add_to_shownotes Action: Implement the planned feature where a voice command like "intern, add a link to that article" triggers a web search and appends the result to the episode's show notes.

4. UI/UX Polish
Replace All Mock Data: Remove any remaining mock data (e.g., the "Recent Activity" feed on the dashboard) and replace it with live data from the backend.

Live Stats Polish: The user dashboard stats are partially mocked. The backend logic in crud.py needs to be built to calculate these for real (e.g., by adding a downloads column to the Episode model).

Toast Notifications: Add user feedback notifications for common actions like "Template Saved," "File Uploaded," or "Error."

Build Out Admin Panel: Expand the AdminDashboard to include the planned but non-existent sections for Settings, Billing management, etc.
