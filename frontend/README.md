# Podcast Pro Plus API & Frontend

## Project Overview

Podcast Pro Plus is a web-based application designed to automate the most tedious parts of podcast production. The goal is to create a system where a user can upload raw audio files, define a template for their show's structure, and have the application automatically handle audio assembly, AI-powered cleanup, transcription, and metadata generation.

This repository contains both the Python/FastAPI backend and the React/Vite frontend.

## Current Status (As of August 1, 2025)

The project has a full-featured backend with a persistent database and a newly scaffolded frontend UI. The core logic for user management, media handling, and episode processing is complete.

**Completed Functionality:**
* **Backend API (FastAPI):**
    * **Full User Authentication:** Secure login/registration with email/password and Google OAuth using JWTs.
    * **Persistent Database:** Uses a SQLite database (`database.db`) to manage users, podcast templates, media files, and episode records.
    * **Media Library:** Endpoints for uploading, categorizing (intro, music, etc.), listing, and deleting user-specific media files.
    * **User-Owned Templates:** Secure endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting podcast templates tied to the logged-in user.
    * **Episode Tracking:** The core audio processing endpoint now creates a persistent record of each assembled episode in the database.
    * **Core Audio Engine:** Can stitch audio, normalize volume, apply complex background music rules, and handle segment overlaps.
    * **AI Processing:** Integrates with OpenAI and ElevenLabs for transcription, filler/pause removal, and metadata generation.

* **Frontend UI (React + shadcn/ui):**
    * **New UI Scaffolding:** The project has been updated to use `shadcn/ui` components, with a new `LandingPage` and `Dashboard` generated by `v0.dev`.
    * **Authentication Flow:** A full login page and authentication context (`AuthContext`) manages user sessions. The app correctly displays the landing page or the main dashboard based on login status.
    * **Functional Components (Ready for Integration):** We have existing, working components for the `TemplateEditor`, `EpisodeAssembler`, `MediaLibrary`, and `EpisodeHistory` that now need to be integrated into the new `Dashboard` UI.

**Immediate Next Steps:**
* Integrate the existing functional React components into the new `Dashboard.jsx` layout, replacing the static mock data with live, interactive components.
* Implement the real Spreaker API upload functionality.
* Build out an admin interface for managing users and system-wide settings.
